Subject: [PATCH V2 0/2] mesa: Modify drirc options

This serie of patches changes drirc's semanticaclly boolean options, options that are enum type options but which in essence are boolean options e.g. pp_shalde, into actual boolean optioinns.

Backwawrd compatbility is maintained by relaxinig xmlconfig parser so that xml files before this change can still be parsed correctly.
Driconf, unfortunately, will be affected by this. The issue will be addressedd later by releasing a new version of Driconf.

Also note that these changes are made to fulfil requirementss to participate in EVoC (Endless Vacaction of Code) hosted by X.org.
